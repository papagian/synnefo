Pithos API
==========

Introduction
------------

Pithos is a storage service implemented by GRNET (http://www.grnet.gr). Data is stored as objects, organized in containers, belonging to an account. This hierarchy of storage layers has been inspired by the OpenStack Object Storage (OOS) API and similar CloudFiles API by Rackspace. The Pithos API follows the OOS API as closely as possible. One of the design requirements has been to be able to use Pithos with clients built for the OOS, without changes.

However, to be able to take full advantage of the Pithos infrastructure, client software should be aware of the extensions that differentiate Pithos from OOS. Pithos objects can be updated, or appended to. Pithos will store sharing permissions per object and enforce corresponding authorization policies. Automatic version management, allows taking account and container listings back in time, as well as reading previous instances of objects.

The storage backend of Pithos is block oriented, permitting efficient, deduplicated data placement. The block structure of objects is exposed at the API layer, in order to encourage external software to implement advanced data management operations.

This document's goals are:

* Define the Pithos ReST API that allows the storage and retrieval of data and metadata via HTTP calls
* Specify metadata semantics and user interface guidelines for a common experience across client software implementations

The present document is meant to be read alongside the OOS API documentation. Thus, it is suggested that the reader is familiar with associated technologies, the OOS API as well as the first version of the Pithos API. This document refers to the second version of Pithos. Information on the first version of the storage API can be found at http://code.google.com/p/gss.

Whatever marked as to be determined (**TBD**), should not be considered by implementors.

Pithos Users and Authentication
-------------------------------

In Pithos, each user is uniquely identified by a token. All API requests require a token and each token is internally resolved to an account string. The API uses the account string to identify the user's own files, thus whether a request is local or cross-account.

Pithos does not keep a user database. For development and testing purposes, user identifiers and their corresponding tokens can be defined in the settings file. However, Pithos is designed with an external authentication service in mind. This service must handle the details of validating user credentials and communicate with Pithos via a middleware software component that, given a token, fills in the internal request account variable.

Client software using Pithos, if not already knowing a user's identifier and token, should forward to the ``/login`` URI. The Pithos server, depending on its configuration will redirect to the appropriate login page.

The login URI accepts the following parameters:

======================  =========================
Request Parameter Name  Value
======================  =========================
next                    The URI to redirect to when the process is finished
renew                   Force token renewal (no value parameter)
force                   Force logout current user (no value parameter)
======================  =========================

When done with logging in, the service's login URI should redirect to the URI provided with ``next``, adding the ``token`` parameters which contains authentication token.

If ``next`` request parameter is missing the call fails with BadRequest (400) response status.

A user management service that implements a login API call according to these conventions is `Astakos <astakos.html>`_, by GRNET.

User feedback
-------------

Client software using Pithos, should forward to the ``/feedback`` URI. The Pithos service, depending on its configuration will delegate the request to the appropriate identity management URI.

============================ =========  ==================
Uri                          Method     Description

401 (Unauthorized)          Missing or expired user token
500 (Internal Server Error) The request cannot be completed because of an internal error
=========================== =====================

User translation catalogs
-------------------------

Client software using Pithos, should forward to the ``/user_catalogs`` URI to get uuid to displayname translations and vice versa. The Pithos service, depending on its configuration will delegate the request to the appropriate identity management URI.

================================= =========  ==================
Uri                               Method     Description
================================= =========  ==================
``/pithos/astakos/user_catalogs`` POST       Get 2 catalogs containing uuid to displayname mapping and the opposite
================================= =========  ==================

|

====================  ===========================
Request Header Name   Value
====================  ===========================
X-Auth-Token          User authentication token
====================  ===========================

The request body is a json formatted dictionary containing a list with uuids and another list of displaynames to translate.

Example request content:

::

  {"displaynames": ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"],
   "uuids":["ff53baa9-c025-4d56-a6e3-963db0438830", "a9dc21d2-bcb2-4104-9a9e-402b7c70d6d8"]}

Example reply:

::

  {"displayname_catalog": {"user1@example.com": "a9dc21d2-bcb2-4104-9a9e-402b7c70d6d8",
                        "user2@example.com": "816351c7-7405-4f26-a968-6380cf47ba1f"},
  'uuid_catalog': {"a9dc21d2-bcb2-4104-9a9e-402b7c70d6d8": "user1@example.com",
                   "ff53baa9-c025-4d56-a6e3-963db0438830": "user2@example.com"}}

The Pithos API
--------------

The URI requests supported by the Pithos API follow one of the following forms:

* Top level: ``https://hostname/v1/``
* Account level: ``https://hostname/v1/<account>``
* Container level: ``https://hostname/v1/<account>/<container>``
* Object level: ``https://hostname/v1/<account>/<container>/<object>``

All requests must include an ``X-Auth-Token`` - as a header, or a parameter.

The allowable request operations and respective return codes per level are presented in the remainder of this chapter. Common to all requests are the following return codes.

==============================  ================================
Return Code                     Description
==============================  ================================
400 (Bad Request)               The request is invalid
401 (Unauthorized)              Missing or invalid token
403 (Forbidden)                 Request not allowed
404 (Not Found)                 The requested resource was not found
413 (Request Entity Too Large)  Insufficient quota to complete the request
503 (Service Unavailable)       The request cannot be completed because of an internal error

format                  Optional extended reply type (can be ``json`` or ``xml``)
meta                    Return objects that satisfy the key queries in the specified comma separated list (use ``<key>``, ``!<key>`` for existence queries, ``<key><op><value>`` for value queries, where ``<op>`` can be one of ``=``, ``!=``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``<``, ``>``)
shared                  Show only objects (no value parameter)

until                   Optional timestamp
======================  ===================================

The ``path`` parameter overrides ``prefix`` and ``delimiter``. When using ``path``, results will include objects ending in ``delimiter``.

The keys given with ``meta`` will be matched with the strings after the ``X-Object-Meta-`` prefix.

The reply is a list of object names. Container headers (as in a ``HEAD`` request) will also be included.
Cross-user requests are not allowed to use ``until`` and include the following limited set of headers in the reply:

===========================  ===============================
Reply Header Name            Value
===========================  ===============================
X-Container-Block-Size       The block size used by the storage backend
X-Container-Block-Hash       The hash algorithm used for block identifiers in object hashmaps
X-Container-Object-Meta      A list with all meta keys used by allowed objects (**TBD**)
Last-Modified                The last container modification date
===========================  ===============================

If a ``format=xml`` or ``format=json`` argument is given, extended information on the objects will be returned, serialized in the chosen format.
For each object, the information will include all object metadata, except user-defined (names will be in lower case and with hyphens replaced with underscores). User-defined metadata includes ``X-Object-Meta-*``, ``X-Object-Manifest``, ``Content-Disposition`` and ``Content-Encoding`` keys. Also, sharing directives will only be included with the actual shared objects (inherited permissions are not calculated):

==========================  ======================================
Name                        Description
==========================  ======================================
name                        The name of the object
hash                        The ETag of the object

x_object_uuid               The object's UUID
x_object_version            The object's version identifier
x_object_version_timestamp  The object's version timestamp
x_object_modified_by        The user that committed the object's version
x_object_sharing            Object permissions (optional)
x_object_allowed_to         Allowed actions on object (optional)
x_object_public             Object's publicly accessible URI (optional: present if the object is public and the request user is the object owner)
==========================  ======================================

Sharing metadata and last modification timestamp will only be returned if there is no ``until`` parameter defined.

Extended replies may also include virtual directory markers in separate sections of the ``json`` or ``xml`` results.
Virtual directory markers are only included when ``delimiter`` is explicitly set. They correspond to the substrings up to and including the first occurrence of the delimiter.
In JSON results they appear as dictionaries with only a ``subdir`` key. In XML results they appear interleaved with ``<object>`` tags as ``<subdir name="..." />``.
In case there is an object with the same name as a virtual directory marker, the object will be returned.

No reply content/headers, except when uploading data, where the reply consists of a list of hashes for the blocks received (in the format specified).

The operation will overwrite all user defined metadata, except if ``update`` is defined.
To change policy, include an ``X-Container-Policy-*`` header with the name in the key. If no ``X-Container-Policy-*`` header is present, no changes will be applied to policy. The ``update`` parameter also applies to policy - deleted values will revert to defaults. To delete/revert a specific policy directive, use ``update`` and an empty header value. See container ``PUT`` for a reference of policy directives.

To upload blocks of data to the container, set ``Content-Type`` to ``application/octet-stream`` and ``Content-Length`` to a valid value (except if using ``chunked`` as the ``Transfer-Encoding``).

The reply is the object's data (or part of it), except if a hashmap is requested with ``hashmap``, or a version list with ``version=list`` (in both cases an extended reply format must be specified). Object headers (as in a ``HEAD`` request) are always included.

Hashmaps expose the underlying storage format of the object. Note that each hash is computed after trimming trailing null bytes of the corresponding block. The ``X-Object-Hash`` header reports the single Merkle hash of the object's hashmap (refer to http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0030.html for more information).

Example ``format=json`` reply:

::

  {"block_hash": "sha1", "hashes": ["7295c41da03d7f916440b98e32c4a2a39351546c", ...], "block_size": 131072, "bytes": 242}

Example ``format=xml`` reply:

    <hash>...</hash>
  </object>

Version lists include the version identifier and timestamp for each available object version. Version identifiers can be arbitrary strings, so use the timestamp to find newer versions.

Example ``format=json`` reply:

::

  {"versions": [[85, "1322734861.248469"], [86, "1322734905.009272"], ...]}

======================  ============================================
Request Parameter Name  Value
======================  ============================================
format                  Optional conflict response type (can be ``json`` or ``xml``)
update                  Do not replace metadata (no value parameter)
======================  ============================================

The ``Content-Encoding``, ``Content-Disposition``, ``X-Object-Manifest`` and ``X-Object-Meta-*`` headers are considered to be user defined metadata. An operation without the ``update`` parameter will overwrite all previous values and remove any keys not supplied. When using ``update`` any metadata with an empty value will be deleted.

To change permissions, include an ``X-Object-Sharing`` header (as defined in ``PUT``). To publish, include an ``X-Object-Public`` header, with a value of ``true``. If no such headers are defined, no changes will be applied to sharing/public. Use empty values to remove permissions/unpublish (unpublishing also works with ``false`` as a header value). Sharing options are applied to the object - not its versions.

To update an object's data:

* Either set ``Content-Type`` to ``application/octet-stream``, or provide an object with ``X-Source-Object``. If ``Content-Type`` has some other value, it will be ignored and only the metadata will be updated.
* If the data is supplied in the request (using ``Content-Type`` instead of ``X-Source-Object``), a valid ``Content-Length`` header is required - except if using chunked transfers (set ``Transfer-Encoding`` to ``chunked``).
* Set ``Content-Range`` as specified in RFC2616, with the following differences:

  * Client software MAY omit ``last-byte-pos`` of if the length of the range being transferred is unknown or difficult to determine.
  * Client software SHOULD not specify the ``instance-length`` (use a ``*``), unless there is a reason for performing a size check at the server.
* If ``Content-Range`` used has a ``byte-range-resp-spec = *``, data will be appended to the object.

Optionally, truncate the updated object to the desired length with the ``X-Object-Bytes`` header.

A data update will trigger an ETag change. Updated ETags may happen asynchronously and appear at the server with a delay.

No reply content. No reply headers if only metadata is updated.

204 (No Content)                The request succeeded (data updated)
400 (Bad Request)               Invalid ``X-Object-Sharing`` or ``X-Object-Bytes`` header or missing ``Content-Range`` header or invalid source object or source object length is smaller than range length or ``Content-Length`` does not match range length
411 (Length Required)           Missing ``Content-Length`` in the request
413 (Request Entity Too Large)  Insufficient quota to complete the request
416 (Range Not Satisfiable)     The supplied range is invalid
==============================  ==============================

The ``POST`` method can also be used for creating an object via a standard HTML form. If the request ``Content-Type`` is ``multipart/form-data``, none of the above headers will be processed. The form should have an ``X-Object-Data`` field, as in the following example. The token is passed as a request parameter. ::

  <form method="post" action="https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/folder/EXAMPLE.txt?X-Auth-Token=0000" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="X-Object-Data">
    <input type="submit">
  </form>

This will create/override the object with the given name, as if using ``PUT``. The ``Content-Type`` of the object will be set to the value of the corresponding header sent in the part of the request containing the data (usually, automatically handled by the browser). Metadata, sharing and other object attributes can not be set this way. The response will contain the object's ETag.

Sharing and Public Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read and write control in Pithos is managed by setting appropriate permissions with the ``X-Object-Sharing`` header. The permissions are applied using directory-based inheritance. A directory is an object with the corresponding content type. The default delimiter is ``/``. Thus, each set of authorization directives is applied to all objects in the directory object where the corresponding ``X-Object-Sharing`` header is defined. If there are nested/overlapping permissions, the closest to the object is applied. When retrieving an object, the ``X-Object-Shared-By`` header reports where it gets its permissions from. If not present, the object is the actual source of authorization directives.

A user may ``GET`` another account or container. The result will include a limited reply, containing only the allowed containers or objects respectively. A top-level request with an authentication token, will return a list of allowed accounts, so the user can easily find out which other users share objects. The ``X-Object-Allowed-To`` header lists the actions allowed on an object, if it does not belong to the requesting user.

Shared objects that are also public do not expose the ``X-Object-Public`` meta information.

Objects that are marked as public, via the ``X-Object-Public`` meta, are also available at the corresponding URI returned for ``HEAD`` or ``GET``. Requests for public objects do not need to include an ``X-Auth-Token``. Pithos will accept only the following request parameter: 

======================  ===================================
Request Parameter Name  Value
======================  ===================================
disposition-type        Optional enforcement of the specific content disposition type (can be ``inline`` or ``attachement`` otherwise it is ignored - this will override the object's Content-Disposition)
======================  ===================================

and only include the following headers in the reply (all ``X-Object-*`` meta is hidden):

==========================  ===============================
Reply Header Name           Value
==========================  ===============================
ETag                        The ETag of the object
Content-Length              The size of the data returned
Content-Type                The MIME content type of the object
Content-Range               The range of data included (only on a single range request)
Last-Modified               The last object modification date (regardless of version)
Content-Encoding            The encoding of the object (optional)
Content-Disposition         The presentation style of the object (optional)
==========================  ===============================

Public objects are not included and do not influence cross-user listings. They are, however, readable by all users.

Summary
^^^^^^^

List of differences from the OOS API:

* Support for ``X-Account-Meta-*`` style headers at the account level. Use ``POST`` to update.
* Support for ``X-Container-Meta-*`` style headers at the container level. Can be set when creating via ``PUT``. Use ``POST`` to update.
* Header ``X-Container-Object-Meta`` at the container level and parameter ``meta`` in container listings. (**TBD**)
* Account and container policies to manage behavior and limits. Container behavior overrides account settings. Account quota sets the maximum bytes limit, regardless of container values.
* Headers ``X-Container-Block-*`` at the container level, exposing the underlying storage characteristics.
* All metadata replies, at all levels, include latest modification information.
* At all levels, a ``HEAD`` or ``GET`` request may use ``If-Modified-Since`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers.
* Container/object lists include more fields if the reply is of type JSON/XML. Some names are kept to their OOS API equivalents for compatibility.
* Option to include only shared containers/objects in listings.
* Object metadata allowed, in addition to ``X-Object-Meta-*``: ``Content-Encoding``, ``Content-Disposition``, ``X-Object-Manifest``. These are all replaced with every update operation, except if using the ``update`` parameter (in which case individual keys can also be deleted). Deleting meta by providing empty values also works when copying/moving an object.
* Multi-range object ``GET`` support as outlined in RFC2616.
* Object hashmap retrieval through ``GET`` and the ``format`` parameter.
* Object create via hashmap through ``PUT`` and the ``format`` parameter.
* The object's Merkle hash is always returned in the ``X-Object-Hash`` header.
* The object's UUID is always returned in the ``X-Object-UUID`` header. The UUID remains unchanged, even when the object's data or metadata changes, or the object is moved to another path (is renamed). A new UUID is assigned when creating or copying an object.
* Object create using ``POST`` to support standard HTML forms.
* Partial object updates through ``POST``, using the ``Content-Length``, ``Content-Type``, ``Content-Range`` and ``Transfer-Encoding`` headers. Use another object's data to update with ``X-Source-Object`` and ``X-Source-Version``. Truncate with ``X-Object-Bytes``.
* Include new version identifier in replies for object replace/change requests.
* Object ``MOVE`` support and ``ignore_content_type`` parameter in both ``COPY`` and ``MOVE``.
* Conditional object create/update operations, using ``If-Match`` and ``If-None-Match`` headers.
* Time-variant account/container listings via the ``until`` parameter.
* Object versions - parameter ``version`` in ``HEAD``/``GET`` (list versions with ``GET``), ``X-Object-Version-*`` meta in replies, ``X-Source-Version`` in ``PUT``/``COPY``.
* Sharing/publishing with ``X-Object-Sharing``, ``X-Object-Public`` at the object level. Cross-user operations are allowed - controlled by sharing directives. Available actions in cross-user requests are reported with ``X-Object-Allowed-To``. Permissions may include groups defined with ``X-Account-Group-*`` at the account level. These apply to the object - not its versions.
* Support for directory-based inheritance when enforcing permissions. Parent object carrying the authorization directives is reported in ``X-Object-Shared-By``.
* Copy and move between accounts with ``X-Source-Account`` and ``Destination-Account`` headers.
* Large object support with ``X-Object-Manifest``.
* Trace the user that created/modified an object with ``X-Object-Modified-By``.
* Purge container/object history with the ``until`` parameter in ``DELETE``.
* Bulk COPY/MOVE/DELETE objects starting with prefix

Clarifications/suggestions:

* All non-ASCII characters in headers should be URL-encoded.
* Authentication is done by another system. The token is used in the same way, but it is obtained differently. The top level ``GET`` request is kept compatible with the OOS API and allows for guest/testing operations.
* Some processing is done in the variable part of all ``X-*-Meta-*`` headers. If it includes underscores, they will be converted to dashes and the first letter of all intra-dash strings will be capitalized.
* A ``GET`` reply for a level will include all headers of the corresponding ``HEAD`` request.
* To avoid conflicts between objects and virtual directory markers in container listings, it is recommended that object names do not end with the delimiter used.
* The ``Accept`` header may be used in requests instead of the ``format`` parameter to specify the desired request/reply format. The parameter overrides the header.
* Container/object lists use a ``200`` return code if the reply is of type JSON/XML. The reply will include an empty JSON/XML.
* In headers, dates are formatted according to RFC 1123. In extended information listings, the ``last_modified`` field is formatted according to ISO 8601 (for OOS API compatibility). All other fields (Pithos extensions) use integer tiemstamps.
* The ``Last-Modified`` header value always reflects the actual latest change timestamp, regardless of time control parameters and version requests. Time precondition checks with ``If-Modified-Since`` and ``If-Unmodified-Since`` headers are applied to this value.
* A copy/move using ``PUT``/``COPY``/``MOVE`` will always update metadata, keeping all old values except the ones redefined in the request headers.
* A ``HEAD`` or ``GET`` for an ``X-Object-Manifest`` object, will include modified ``Content-Length`` and ``ETag`` headers, according to the characteristics of the objects under the specified prefix. The ``Etag`` will be the MD5 hash of the corresponding ETags concatenated. In extended container listings there is no metadata processing.

Recommended Practices and Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming an authentication token is obtained, the following high-level operations are available - shown with ``curl``:

* Get account information ::

    curl -X HEAD -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid

* List available containers ::

    curl -X GET -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid

* Get container information ::

    curl -X HEAD -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/pithos

* Add a new container ::

    curl -X PUT -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/test

* Delete a container ::

    curl -X DELETE -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/test

* List objects in a container ::

    curl -X GET -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/pithos

* List objects in a container (extended reply) ::

    curl -X GET -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/pithos?format=json

  It is recommended that extended replies are cached and subsequent requests utilize the ``If-Modified-Since`` header.

* List metadata keys used by objects in a container

  Will be in the ``X-Container-Object-Meta`` reply header, included in container information or object list (``HEAD`` or ``GET``). (**TBD**)

* List objects in a container having a specific meta defined ::

    curl -X GET -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/pithos?meta=favorites

* Retrieve an object ::

    curl -X GET -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/pithos/README.txt

* Retrieve an object (specific ranges of data) ::

    curl -X GET -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         -H "Range: bytes=0-9" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/pithos/README.txt

  This will return the first 10 bytes. To get the first 10, bytes 30-39 and the last 100 use ``Range: bytes=0-9,30-39,-100``.

* Add a new object (folder type) (**TBD**) ::

    curl -X PUT -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/directory" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/pithos/folder

* Add a new object ::

    curl -X PUT -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
         -T EXAMPLE.txt
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/pithos/folder/EXAMPLE.txt

* Update an object ::

    curl -X POST -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         -H "Content-Length: 10" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
         -H "Content-Range: bytes 10-19/*" \
         -d "0123456789" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/folder/EXAMPLE.txt

  This will update bytes 10-19 with the data specified.

* Update an object (append) ::

    curl -X POST -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         -H "Content-Length: 10" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
         -H "Content-Range: bytes */*" \
         -d "0123456789" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/folder/EXAMPLE.txt

* Update an object (truncate) ::

    curl -X POST -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         -H "X-Source-Object: /folder/EXAMPLE.txt" \
         -H "Content-Range: bytes 0-0/*" \
         -H "X-Object-Bytes: 0" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/folder/EXAMPLE.txt

  This will truncate the object to 0 bytes.

* Add object metadata ::

    curl -X POST -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         -H "X-Object-Meta-First: first_meta_value" \
         -H "X-Object-Meta-Second: second_meta_value" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/folder/EXAMPLE.txt

* Delete object metadata ::

    curl -X POST -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         -H "X-Object-Meta-First: first_meta_value" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/folder/EXAMPLE.txt

  Metadata can only be "set". To delete ``X-Object-Meta-Second``, reset all metadata.

* Delete an object ::

    curl -X DELETE -D - \
         -H "X-Auth-Token: 0000" \
         https://storage.example.synnefo.org/pithos/object-store/v1.0/user-uuid/folder/EXAMPLE.txt
